   <h1> Virtualization</h1>
   <p>In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual(rather than actual) version of something, this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>
   <h1> Levels of Virtualizaton</h1>
   <ol>
  <li><b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</b></li>
  <p>Every machine has an instruction set .This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.
Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.
</p>
  <li><b>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</b></li>
  <p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
  <li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware. </li>

</ul>
